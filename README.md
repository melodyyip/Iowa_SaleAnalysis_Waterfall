# Iowa_SaleAnalysis_Waterfall

Waterfall chart shows a running total as values are added or subtracted. It's useful for understanding how an initial value is affected by a series of positive and negative values.
The columns are color coded so you can quickly tell positive from negative numbers. The initial and the final value columns often start on the horizontal axis, while the intermediate values are floating columns. Because of this "look", waterfall charts are also called bridge charts.
